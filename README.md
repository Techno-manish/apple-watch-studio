### **Key Features to Implement**

#### **1. Case Selection**

- Implement an interactive grid for available Apple Watch cases in various materials (e.g., Aluminum, Titanium).
- Add hover effects for a sleek and responsive experience.
- Ensure the watch preview updates in real-time based on the selected case.

#### **2. Size Selection**

- Add interactive toggles for selecting watch sizes (e.g., 42mm, 46mm).
- Dynamically update the displayed price and product description based on size selection.

#### **3. Band Selection**

- Create an interactive carousel for scrolling through band options, including various styles and colors.
- Ensure the watch preview dynamically updates based on the selected band.
- Organize band types (e.g., Solo Loop, Braided Solo Loop) for easy selection.

#### **4. Collection Switching**

- Implement a dropdown or modal to switch between different collections (e.g., Series 10, Hermès, SE).
- Ensure smooth transitions between collections, updating relevant options dynamically.

#### **5. Real-Time Price Updates**

- Dynamically calculate and display the total price of the watch configuration as selections are made.

#### **6. Save and Share Functionality**

- Add a **Save** button to allow users to save their customized configuration as an image or URL.
- Include shareable links for social media platforms.

#### **7. Animations and User Experience**

- Add subtle animations to enhance the user experience:
  - Smooth transitions.
  - Hover effects.
  - Loading spinners during interactions.

### **Design Requirements**

- **Pixel-Perfect Precision:**
  - Replicate the Apple Watch Studio's aesthetic with exact details (fonts, spacing, margins, colors, animations).
- **Interactive and Responsive:**

  - Ensure the UI is fully functional across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **High Performance:**

  - Focus on smooth interactions and fast loading times.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Implement accessible design principles (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

---

### **Expected Output**

#### **1. Deployment Link**

- Host the project on a platform like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
- The deployment should be publicly accessible.

#### **2. GitHub Repository**

- Share a **public GitHub repository** link for the project.
- The repo should include a detailed README explaining setup, features, and implementation.

#### **3. Loom Walkthrough**

- Record a **5-minute Loom video** demonstrating the implementation process.
- Walk through key code sections and demonstrate the UI's functionality in the video.
